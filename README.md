https://softuni.bg/trainings/3964/python-oop-february-2023

The Python OOP course will teach you the principles of object-oriented programming (OOP), working with classes and objects, using object-oriented modeling, and building class hierarchies. Basic principles of OOP such as abstraction (interfaces, abstract classes), encapsulation, inheritance and polymorphism will be studied. We will go into the most commonly used design patterns. We will learn what iterators and generators are and how to use them. We will focus on unit testing (writing unit tests) and the concept of Test Driven Development (TDD).
